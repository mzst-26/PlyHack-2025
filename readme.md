## ChartMaps
ChartMaps enables users to explore and visualize popular song data from across the globe. The platform allows users to view the top 10 songs of the day for each country. Utilizing an algorithm, ChartMaps generates a unique color based on the titles of these top 10 songs, which is then applied to the respective country on the map. If multiple countries share a similar color, it indicates that they are listening to similar songs, highlighting regional or global musical trends.

# or
